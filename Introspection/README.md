# INTROSPECTION
## why must we choose you?
I have great interest in being part of and contributing to the open source community as I feel that it is one of the only place where you have some freedom from the large corporations that constantly monitor us. I would hope to be able to make contributions of value to the FOSS space. 
## what is your plan for the next 6 months?
I'm currenly interested in working on a few apps for trading stocks, music production or gamedev.
## How would you contribute back to the club? 
I will participate in as many club activities as possible. I can also make documentation for projects that are lacking it.
## Do you have any feedback on the selection process?
I thought there was good variety in these selections, so I dont have much to say.

Pentesting might have been a good addition though.
